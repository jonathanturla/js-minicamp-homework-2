# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* for loop
	* && || !
	* Array
	* git
	* GitHub
	
Answers:
	for loop - a chunk of code that is executed repeatedly for a certain number of times. We specify the number of times it executes by introducing a "counter" variable in the argument of the for loop. The counter initial value, conditional statement of the counter (what value should the counter have), and what will happen with the counter after each iteration (decrease, increase, etc.) should be declared in the argument of the for loop.
	&& || ! - these are special characters that are used to compare things. The result of the comparison results to boolean values: either true or false. '&&' or pronounced as "AND" results to a value of true if both of the statements are true, otherwise it returns false. '||'  or pronounced as "OR" results to a value of true as long as one of the statements is true; otherwise it returns false. Lastly, "!" or pronounced as "NOT" is used to invert the value. For example, if it's "TRUE" it will return false, and if it's "FALSE" it will return true.
	Array - unlike a normal variable which can only have a single value, arrays can hold multiple values. The value of an array can be accessed using an index that starts from 0 up to the number of values you have in your array minus one. For example, if you have two values in your array, the first value will have an index of '0', and the last value will have an index of '1'. If you have three values in your array, the first value will have an index of '0', the second value will have an index of '1', and the last value wil have an index of '2'.
	Github - it's an online repository that can be accessed on the Internet. We use it along with a version controller program called 'git' to manage our files, and be able to collaborate with others. How this happens is that each of us can have a copy of the same file, and be able to make changes with it. We then can recommend these changes to the owner of the file, and if the owner of the file likes it, the owner can apply and save these changes to the original file.
	


2. Install git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master


4. Make the tests pass!
